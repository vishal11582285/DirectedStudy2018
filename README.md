# DirectedStudy2018
This project is part of my directed study under Professor Assefaw Gebremedhin at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University.

Abstract:
The purpose of this study is to explore various epidemic models in order to simulate infection spread in a population. These models help us to have a realistic approximation of the future development of the disease which can enable health care professionals or epidemiologists to develop proactive measures to contain the spread of a possible epidemic. Epidemic modelling as a tool can
not just benefit healthcare but can be extended to other applications like adoption of rumours in social network or spread of virus in networked computers. In this study, we aim to highlight few important models with arbitrary case studies while also elaborating on relevant vaccination strategies.
